# Example Plugin

Example code for a plugin that opens a menu for a player.

## Usage
Players can open the demo menu with the `/canvas` command in the game. A base 
menu will open for the player with some information about their name and level. 
Additionally, there is a debug item which outputs logging information about 
clicks in the console. There is also an item to open a new menu where the player
can move items around inside.
